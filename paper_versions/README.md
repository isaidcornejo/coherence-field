# Paper Versions Archive

This directory contains the historical versions of the manuscript associated with:

**“A Scalar Diagnostic for Empirical Score Alignment on Fisher Manifolds”**

The purpose of this archive is to preserve the evolution of the scientific document across major revisions without cluttering the main `paper/` directory. Each version is stored in its own folder and includes the compiled PDF and optional internal notes.

## 📁 Structure

```

    v1/
        coherence-field.pdf
        notes.txt                # optional internal notes for version 1

```

* **`v1/`**
  Contains the original *Coherence Field* manuscript, based on the scalar φ(θ) formulation.

* **`v2/`**
  Contains the new manuscript based on the spectral diagnostic
  **A(θ; q) = Tr(G⁻¹C) – D** and the alignment operator **H = G⁻¹C**, reflecting a major conceptual revision.

## 📝 Versioning Policy

* Each new scientific revision is stored in its own numbered folder (`v3`, `v4`, …).
* Folders only contain **final PDFs** and optional **internal notes** (e.g., `revision_notes.md`).
* The active working version of the paper lives only in the main `paper/` directory.
* Version numbers do **not** appear in the filename of the manuscript itself; versions are handled at the folder level.

## 🎯 Purpose

This archive:

* preserves the scientific development of the project,
* maintains reproducibility for citations,
* provides a clear historical record of conceptual changes,
* isolates legacy manuscripts from the current working version.

---

If additional versions are produced (v3, v4, …), simply create a new folder following the same structure and naming conventions.
